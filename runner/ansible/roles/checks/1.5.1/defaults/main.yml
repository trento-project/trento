  Test if the /etc/hosts file contains all the cluster nodes

  ## Abstract
  If using host names in the cluster configuration, it is vital to have reliable host name resolution.
  The cluster communication will fail, if the names are not available and that can lead to cluster failover delays.
  The benefit of using /etc/hosts is that your cluster becomes independent of DNS, which could be a single point
  of failures too.Name resolution of cluster nodes and virtual IPs is recommended to be local.

  ## Remedation
  Specify IP addresses of all cluster nodes in the /etc/hosts.
