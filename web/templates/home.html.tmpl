                        such as the hostname, its IP address, to what cluster it belongs and a list of
                        all the tags that have been set by the discovery mechanisms to classify each
                        host accordingly.

                        In this view are listed the SAP Systems, usually identified by a SID or
                        `SAP System Identification` string such as `PRD`, `DEV`, or `QAS`. These are used
                        often to identify productive, development and quality assurance systems.
                        In this view we get an overview of the distribution of each SID, the number of
                        hosts discovered of each of them and additional details.
